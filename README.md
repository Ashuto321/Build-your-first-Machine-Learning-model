🧠 Build Your First Machine Learning Model

In this repository, I've created a simple and effective machine learning project that demonstrates how to:

Train models using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression

Use scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

Compare model performances using visualization

Prepare the model for deployment

🚀 What’s Inside
This project is a great starting point for beginners to understand:

How to load and explore a dataset using pandas

How to preprocess data and split it into train/test sets

How to train and evaluate models using:

LinearRegression

RandomForestRegressor

How to visualize prediction results and compare models

How to save and load trained models (for deployment)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn (sklearn)


📈 Model Comparison
The models are trained and tested on the same dataset to show how a simple linear model compares against a non-linear ensemble model like Random Forest. Plots are included to help you visualize the differences in predictions.
